With this Client AddIn, a new tab is available to be added to the client.  When an interaction is added, if the "Url" call attribute is set then that url will be navigated to in the browser window.  If that attribute is not set, then the browser will be loaded with a "Url Attribute is not set" text.

This AddIn demonstrates how to use the QueueMonitor and AddInWindow classes.
