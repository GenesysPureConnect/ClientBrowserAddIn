With this Client AddIn, a new tab is available to be added to the client.  This tab embeds a full web browser.  There is an additional feature that when an interaction is added, if the "Url" call attribute is set then that url will be navigated to in the browser window. 

This AddIn demonstrates how to use the QueueMonitor and AddInWindow classes.
